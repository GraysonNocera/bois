Ideas from Professor Koh:

Model this problem as an undirected, unweighted graph with the nodes being each individual.
One idea: have a 2D adjacency list as well as a list of all nonzero indices in this 2D 
array. Then, we randomly pull from that array of indices to get a nonzero value.

Maintain a current graph for this week and a graph for next week. 

After we make a random choice, swap that choice with the last one in the array (move the picked 
choice to the end) and then redefine the size of our array to be one less.

For odd number: create one more "fake person" to make it even then solve it. After that, 
reassign whoever is with the fake person to a group in which they have only seen at most 
one of the people (not 2) in the group.
